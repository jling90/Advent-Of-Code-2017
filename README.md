# Advent-Of-Code-2017

`R` is an interesting programming language which finds its home mostly in statistical computing.
My objective is to explore some of the interesting (occasionally just strange) design choices which
make `R` such a powerful, albeit niche, language.  With several extra years of experience since I 
last touched the language I'm revisiting it as a beginner with fresh eyes. 

Along the way I expect to unknowingly trip over style guides and conventions. I have no intention of
being prosaic with my code comments, so come join me on this weird adventure.
